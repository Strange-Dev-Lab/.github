# 👾 Strange Dev Lab

**Strange Dev Lab** is a small, focused developer apprenticeship lab.  
We build **real products** with a **real team structure** – not tutorials, not toy projects.  

For 4 months, each cohort works together like a startup team:  
**PRDs → Design → Backend → Frontend → Review → Deploy → Iterate.**

---

## 🚀 What we do

At Strange Dev Lab, we:

- **Train a small dev squad** (3–4 interns at a time) in a real, production-style environment.  
- **Build real-world web apps** using a modern JavaScript stack:  
  - Backend: **Express.js**  
  - Database: **PostgreSQL**  
  - Frontend: **Next.js**  
- **Ship live products**, hosted and accessible to real users.  
- Practice **clean Git workflows, code reviews, stand-ups, and sprints** like an actual company team.  

Every cohort leaves with:

- A **deployed application** they helped build.  
- **Visible GitHub contributions** they can talk about in interviews.  
- Experience working with **PRDs, UI/UX handoff, and team processes**, similar to real engineering teams.

## 🧠 How we work

We keep things simple but serious:

- **Small team, big responsibility**  
  Everyone owns features end-to-end: from reading the spec to shipping and fixing bugs.  

- **Product-first mindset**  
  We don’t just write code. We ask: _Who is this for?_ and _Does this actually solve a real problem?_  

- **Real rituals**  
  - Weekly sprint planning and prioritization  
  - Frequent stand-ups  
  - Code reviews for every PR  
  - Demo sessions to present what we’ve built  

- **Feedback culture**  
  Mistakes are expected. Hiding them is not. We learn in public, together.

## 🧩 Tech stack

**Core stack**

- 🟦 **Backend:** Express.js (Node.js)  
- 🐘 **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- ⚛️ **Frontend:** Next.js  

**Collaboration & tooling**

- 🐙 **GitHub** – repos, issues, pull requests  
- 📋 **Trello / project board** – sprints and tasks  
- 💬 **Slack** – communication, stand-ups, and announcements  

We deliberately stick to a lean stack so interns can go deep, not just wide.

## 🎯 Who Strange Dev Lab is for

Strange Dev Lab is ideal if you:

- Know the **basics of web development** (HTML/CSS/JS, some backend or frontend).  
- Are tired of only building **tutorial-level projects**.  
- Want to feel what it’s like to work in a **real dev team shipping real software**.

It’s not for you if you:

- Just want to “collect certificates”.  
- Don’t have time to commit weekly.  
- Aren’t willing to receive and act on feedback.

## 🧭 Our philosophy

- **Apprenticeship before titles**  
  We care more about **skills and habits** than about calling ourselves a “big company”. The company will grow out of the craft.  

- **Ownership over busywork**  
  Interns don’t just “help out” – they **own features**, write code that matters, and see their work go live.  

- **Ship > Perfect**  
  We favor simple, working solutions over endless polishing. We can refactor what exists. We can’t refactor what never shipped.

## 💼 Want to join a future cohort?

Cohorts are small and selective. When applications are open:

- We’ll share details in this profile and on our channels.  
- You’ll typically go through:
  - A short application form.  
  - A small code challenge or portfolio review.  
  - A friendly interview focused on **how you learn and work**, not trick questions.  

If you’re reading this and there’s no info yet, we’re probably deep in work with the current cohort. That’s a good sign.
